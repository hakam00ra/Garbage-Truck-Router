This is a Garbage Truck Route simulator. Drag and drop a .txt file containing a list of coordinates like coordinates.txt:
```c
40.7278, -73.9964
40.7284, -73.9962
40.7291, -73.9960
40.7298, -73.9958
40.7305, -73.9956
40.7312, -73.9954
40.7319, -73.9952
40.7326, -73.9950
```

This app will get the directions for that route via OSRM routing engine.
